Before the demo session even began, (link:http://www.tapestryconference.com/ text:Tapestry) was humming	 with talk of "(link:http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/ text:Lyra)." A group gathered around (link:https://twitter.com/arvindsatya1 text:Arvind Satyanarayan) as he took us for a spin around the tool he helped developed at (link:http://idl.cs.washington.edu/ text:UW Interactive Data Lab.)

It's just a few day later and the tool's open source code is (link:https://github.com/uwdata/lyra text:up on Github). You can (link:http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/app/ text:run the app) yourself in the browser and now (link:http://vallandingham.me/make_a_barchart_with_lyra.html text:the first tutorial about Lyra) has been written. 


Jim Vallandingham's (link:http://vallandingham.me/make_a_barchart_with_lyra.html text:Lyra tutorial) is naturally a tentative investigation of an app that is in early alpha. It does a fantastic job of teasing apart the current features of Lyra and making predictions about how it can be used in the future. Some sections are highlighted below.

## Let's Make a Bar Chart with Lyra

(imgslide: content/61-lyra/lyra-2.gif)

Using the example data in Lyra, Jim takes us step by step through creating a simple visualization of gold medals by country in the 2014 Sochi Olympics. It's a simple chart but it keeps the tutorial manageable and encourages others to go further. The tutorial is peppered with animated gifs and annotated screenshots that are easy to follow. He leaves us with some "homework" at the end as well: 

> If you want to build on this example, what about filtering out countries with 0 gold medals?

> Right now India, Armenia, etc are shown, but their bar values are really 0. Try filtering out these countries and re-situating the visual elements to take up this extra space.

> For the more adventurous, try getting a visual display for all 3 types of medals. This might involve using the Group By Transform to add some hierarchy to the data.

## Comparisons

(imgslide: content/61-lyra/lyra-3.png blockquote: <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalk">Watch Bret's full talk</a> or <a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum">read the notes</a>)

> Lyra’s binding capabilities allow for comparisons to some of what is featured in (link:http://worrydream.com/#!/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum text:Bret Victor’s Drawing Dynamic Visualizations) tool. If his tool is released, it will be interesting to compare further.

I heard comparisons to Bret Victor's proposed tool at Tapestry as well. Lyra seems like the distillation of several needs felt by the visualization community and undoubtedly has lots of potential.

## Finding its place

(imgslide: content/61-lyra/dd-raw1.gif blockquote: <a href="http://thewhyaxis.info/raw">Read the review of RAW on The Why Axis</a>)

> It has some overlap with (link:http://densitydesign.org/ text:Density Design’s) wonderful (link:http://raw.densitydesign.org/ text:RAW) app. While RAW is more polished, I think Lyra might ultimately provide a more powerful feature set for those interested in learning the tool.

I think Lyra is a stronger challenge to (link:http://www.tableausoftware.com/ text:Tableau) than RAW. While incredibly early in its life, Lyra is positioned well to be adopted and improved by the data visualization community in a way that Tableau can't match. Every gripe about Tableau will stay a gripe while power-users can actively improve Lyra by contributing to the open source project. 

Jim goes on to say: 

> (link:http://d3js.org/ text:D3)’s success in the data visualization world has been in part because of its large thriving community. And this large community was built up quickly in part because of the many examples provided by the authors as well as other individuals.

Jim has started the ball rolling with his tutorial. I'll be adding new resources and reviews of Lyra here as I come across them
