# The Landscape of Climate Finance 
http://www.vizzuality.com/

To coincide with my Visualizing.org gallery, "Making Climate Change Visual," I wanted to feature about a project that I couldn't include (since it hasn't been uploaded to the site). 

>"My Description"

The Landscape of Climate Finance is a web-based slide deck built to promote the 2013 report from the Climate Policy Initiative. The slides examine climate change through the lens of money rather than the latest scientific study. 

This brass tax approach to climate change is unique an interesting but clashes with the polished presentation that invokes the emotional approach of "An Inconvenient Truth."

This brass tax approach to climate change is unique and interesting but clashes with the more emotional presentation style reminiscent of "An Inconvenient Truth."

The six main slides feature simple messages and visualizations overlaid on photographic backgrounds. Many have orange click points to prompt readers to interact. When clicked these reveal scale changes and show proportions nicely. Simple animation and minimal interactivity helps the reader pay more attention to each slide. 

The last slide points readers toward a Sankey diagram of financial flows and a map of the destinations of climate finance. These feel somewhat marginalized, leaving me to wonder why they couldn't be woven into the narrative of the main report. 

Similarly, hidden away on the report download page, there is a graphics library that houses several other useful visualizations from the report. These treemaps stand in contrast to the simple pie charts and bubbles used in the web presentation. They do reveal other interesting aspects not discussed in the main presentation such as the uses of climate finance. 

It's difficult to strike a balance between simplifying things for readers and under-informing them. The Landscape of Climate Finance does a good job but I'd encourage them to go a step further an integrate the full contents of the report into an interactive format. They'd be in good company with The Chronicle of Higher Education and the OECD in creating comprehensive reports for consumption on the web. I see it as a trend that will become the norm in the not so distant future. 

In creating the gallery for visualizing.org I found myself reaching for just a few examples of climate change visualizations. 1 

I'd like to create a collection of quality visualizations that tackle an aspect of climate change (that isn't restricted to the database of Visualizing.org). If you can think of any please leave them in the comments below or send them to @thewhyaxis on Twitter.

- Insurance industry’s climate change dithering could be catastrophic for global economy

- Insurers and financial firms are scooping up experts in natural disaster risk

> "This is a bit heavy on the presentation, but it's a decent data story about the financial side of global warming."

The Landscape of Climate Finance examines the monetary aspect of climate change. It's an interesting and practical lens to view the issue though. Money moves mountains and investing against the threat of climate change would seem like a smart move for everyone. 


Rather than focus on the latest scientific study this report examines the issue through the lens of money. 


feature simple messages and visualizations 


 quickly tell the story of public and private 

The Landscape of Climate Finance is comprised of a series of vertically scrolling slides featuring a simple message and visualization. They tell the story of public and private investment in climate change initiatives





Finance is an interesting lens through which to view climate change. The report reveals that investors focus on local issues because the risk is perceived to be lower. 



more climate change investment is needed

Falling behind globally agreed upon goals for emission levels

Knowing how finance is flowing is important. will help us close the gap. 

Most of climate finance is spent domestically 
perceived to be lower risk. 

Privat v. public 
Mostly Private 
Public sector provides a lot too (135bn)
> Providing incentives, low-cost loans, risk coverage mechanisims, direct project investment, and technical support.

Public is dwarfed by government support for fossil fuels in developing countries alone. 

> climate related investments have fallen well short of even the most conservative needs estimates for successive years, making the requirement of ‘catch up’ very real.

> For policymakers already under pressure to demonstrate value for money, there is renewed urgency to deliver precious public resources in ways that level the carbon playing field and create incentives for private investors to significantly accelerate their investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient growth options.

> Private capital flows into climate investments when public incentives and money make them commercially attractive by taking-off risk and reducing incremental costs.
