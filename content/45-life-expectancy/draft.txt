Title: Life Expectancy from Washington Post
----
Text:

In December the Washington Post published a visualization which attempts to answer the question asked directly in its title "(link:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/healthy-life-expectancy/ text:How long will we live - and how well?)" This interactive scatterplot was created in 7 days to support (link:http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/burden-of-disease-study-shows-a-world-living-longer-and-with-more-disability/2012/12/13/9d1e5278-4320-11e2-8061-253bccfc7532_story.html text:an article about the release of the Global Burden of Disease Study).

I talked to (link:https://twitter.com/eschow/ text:Emily Chow) from the (link:https://twitter.com/PostGraphics text:Post Graphics team) who told me the team's goal with this visualization was: 

> to illustrate how healthy life expectancy has changed since 1990. 

Every news organization should have a good scatter plot in their tool belt. The Washington post makes good use of this one to show a broad distribution of worldwide data. Simple color coding and annotations go a long way to illustrate a point with a scatterplot. This particular chart is made even more useful by animating to reflect choices made by the user (selecting Men / Women and 1990 / 2010).

There are, however, some small user interface enhancements that would greatly improve this scatterplot as a reusable component for future visualizations. 

The toggles (Men / Women and 1990 / 2010), and hence the current selection, aren't prominently displayed. To give the user a sense of place and to label the current chart these options could be moved to the top left of the visualization and perhaps changed to a more visible "selected" style and color.

The color key serves to label the regions represented but these aren't always easy to parse on the graph itself. Turning the color key into a set of filters would make focusing on a singular region intuitive and simple. 

If the user wants to get more specific they can hover over a country and see more detailed data. One small win would be to add a small visualization in these hovers instead of a mini table. The problem with caring too much about a particular dot is that following that dot through changes in selection (animation) is no easy feat. Rather than having users select a country from the drop down above, they should be able to directly click to select a country they'd like to follow.

When it comes to understanding the changes and results of the graph, the annotations go along way. Though easily overlooked, the summary annotations deliver a lot of insight on the graph in a little package. Made more prominent, these could leave users with stronger takeaways for each state of the chart.

> The angle that we found interesting was the fact that life expectancy is generally longer than it was 20 years ago, but that doesn't mean that we are actually living healthier livesâ€¦ The percentage of the percentage of years that are considered healthy has actually decreased overall. 

Emily and the Washington Post team decided to show this by comparing life expectancy in years to the percentage years lived in good heath (instead of total healthy years lived). Though this is a slight layer of abstraction here, the real question to me is whether or not the chart type and animation effectively demonstrates that a smaller percentage of healthy years are lived. 

[1990 v 2010]

Because the chart simultaneously plots the multitude points on two axis and then animates both I think it's extremely difficult to see this overall trend represented with this chart type.

The team did explore several other chart types in their process, some of which had very promising aspects. My favorite was this parallel coordinate form which quickly shows some dramatic outliers that are difficult to pick out in the animated scatter plot. The team encoded the years of unhealthy life as the thickness of the bars and planned to taper the thickness to show direction from 1990 to 2010 in later iterations.

In the end they decided to moved away from this version.  

> The chart bordered on not being able to fit on one screen, which would affect comprehensibility, and I personally found the amount of overlap in Africa to be overwhelming, to the point in which the patterns are harder to draw out.

--

They also tried a mirrored bar graph that looks a bit like a population pyramid. It seems they were playing with bar thicknesses here as well but in the end: 

> The bar chart didn't go far. The graphic was just too deep. It's hard to compare Afghanistan with Zambia and was fairly one dimensional. It's easier to understand the number of years lost to disability, but the strengths pretty much stop there.

--

The original studies the team was provided with included scatterplots so this visualization form was on the table from the start. We saw something similar happen when the WIDE visualization extended precedents set in the original tableau charts created by UNESCO. 

Emily and the team tried a number of iterations using the scatter plot form: 

> If we overlay the years much like Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation did, the scatterplot tells more of a story but also gets hairy and cluttered in the middle where most countries are positioned. We also considered building out smaller multiples laid out in a grid, but the points became too small to interact with.

She also drew inspiration from an earlier Washington Post graphic published by Wilson Andrews giving a global look at body mass index and diabetes. Here the labels help the chart tremendously and there are even trails for the individual points over time which are revealed individually, cleaning up any hairball that might result from displaying them all. 

However, in the case of the Life Expectancy chart, I don't think trails and labels would solve the ultimate problem of showing the smaller percentage of healthy years in 2010. 

--

To remedy this I would suggest the team revisit the parallel coordinates option. Here I've come up with a sketch that addresses the concerns that led the team away from this type originally (space and visual noise). 	

[]

The chart separates life expectancy from healthy years and displays the trends independently. Basic filtering and hover states make comparison much easier. Showing all countries would get quite complicated but I believe it would still show the overall trends and outliers. Not to mention showing all data points simultaneously is not necessarily the goal of visualizing it. 

--

While the scatterplot displays all the data efficiently it doesn't communicate that ultimate insight that the team discovered. I would encourage Emily and the team, and all visualization teams to make decisions based on the winning form and then solve for practical or technical concerns. Issues of visual space and filtering can be solved much easier than trying to transmit understanding through the wrong lens.
