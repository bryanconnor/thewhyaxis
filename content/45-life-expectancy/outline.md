# Goals, intro, 7 days
Our goal was to illustrate how healthy life expectancy has changed since 1990.
# Small UI / Exploration
- filter regions with key
- toggles aren't prominent - assume you're seeing men + women. 
- Select and deselect dots yourself. no drop down. location data. 
plot the dot of you. not much "personalization"
show graphs in hovers

# Summary Results
Highlight summary annotations
- women - 69 years with 11 years disability
- global gains 9 months of health for every year of life. 

# Goals Failed
- fails to show change over time, except one at a time or ALL.
> animation is hard to follow and axis are hard to read
- No trails (gap minder)

# Process
- alternate versions - parallel works better
> cited screen size limitations / overlaps
> agree that thickness doesn't work well. 

Doesn't actually want to show change over time in life expect.

want's to compare the change in life expectancy over time with 
the change in % of healthy years over time. 

% of years considered healthy has decreased overall. 

The purpose of the visualization was to support an article about the Global Burden of Disease Study. It came out in December and the post has 7 days to write and article and create this data visualization about the findings. 	

# Proposal for alternate
