First, what was the purpose of creating this visualization? How does it relate to the accompanying article? 

What kind of constraints did this project have? Time? Technical? Other? 

Can you talk about the data source a bit? How did you simplify it, what did you decide to leave out or to highlight? It seems like you focused on the outcomes and left out the contributing factors (http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/gbd/visualizations/gbd-2010-leading-causes-and-risks-region-heat-map). Can you talk about why? 	

Were there any alternative versions you considered? If so would you mind showing them, perhaps with a short description of their strengths and weaknesses? What led you to using a scatter plot? 

Gapminder comes to mind when looking at this visualization. Would you cite it as a reference? Was there any talk about using trails to show changes in the display? 

What technology was used to implement this graphic? Were there any challenges or limitations there? 

Any other insights into your design process would be greatly appreciated by our readers. 

>> "The calculations are made for two points in time — 1990 and 2010. As a consequence, the study reveals how the world’s health has changed over two decades and provides a trajectory of where it may be headed. The purpose is to give governments, international agencies, donors and researchers an idea of what to plan for."
