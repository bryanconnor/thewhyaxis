Primarily point people towards the making of article with quotes: 

> "Right off the bat, there was a general thought about getting a database online showing the history of mass killings in America, and USA Today’s database team started the painstaking process of building a data set."

> "[The Team's] data journey was still early, because their initial analysis showed that the FBI’s data was limited and often inaccurate and didn’t include any narratives of the cases.

> We played around with how to best highlight patterns, at that point just thinking of these as standalone charts. That early exploration boiled down to three main ideas:
	> A filtered data table and map that would show the mass killings by type of weapon, by how victims died, number of victims, or by filtering text strings;
	> An interactive histogram of the victims by age and by how they were killed;
	> A timeline of the killings that would show both frequency and year-by-year trends.

> None of us liked the idea of just running a couple of standalone charts, especially since the data revealed a number of counter-intuitive findings 

>  We used the timeline first because it immediately communicates the frequency and severity of mass killings over the last eight years. People on Twitter have probably responded to that one more than any other, because they can see right away just how pervasive the events are.

> One of the most helpful things we did, about a month before we launched, was put the app in front of a user test panel via our information architecture team. 

> One was that people really got the data visualizations, they got the design, and they found the content compelling. But occasionally, they told us a headline wasn’t clear, so we rewrote one or two. The second was that our navigation wasn’t the best. At the time, we did not have the page up/down buttons and were relying on people to navigate by scrolling. That works when you have a longform text-heavy presentation but not in something like this where there are lots of transitions from photos to graphics with lots of space. People were having a hard time understanding where they were in the overall presentation. So, we added the up/down buttons to more intentionally walk readers through, and then the dots in each chapter as a signal for location.

# My Thoughts
Scrolling is kind of annoying, almost forced to use the arrows 
timeline is brilliant
there are a lot of states but you can link to each one
