# Vizify Acquired by Yahoo

Yahoo has been on an acquisition spree to fix its biggest problem - (link:http://qz.com/184046/yahoo-says-marissa-mayer-has-fixed-its-biggest-problem/ text:a lack of talent) - and (link:https://www.vizify.com/yahoo#transition text:Vizify) is it's latest pick. 

While Vizify is not particularly innovative in its use of data visualization, its acquisition is meaningful for the field. It indicates that visualization talent is valued and sought after and that a consumer web service can be built around visualizing data. It's also the only acquisition of a visualization-focused product by a major tech company that I can think of since (link:http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/the-value-of-techcrunch50-mint-acquired-by-intuit-for-170m-two-years-after-winning-tc40 text:Mint.com was acquired by Intuit) in 2009. 

I've also noticed other signs of the visualization field maturing in the digital age. Tools for creating visualizations are being built at a more rapid pace and are filling more niches than ever before. As visualizations become easier to create more people are making them. The end result is greater data visualization literacy for the general public.








Vizify isn't necessarily a success story for visualization. The company was acquired before the dreaded _Series A_ round of funding and obviously well it reached profitability. It's proof consumers are interested in sharing visualizations but not that you can build a business around it.
