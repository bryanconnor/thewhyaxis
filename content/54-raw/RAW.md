# RAW

Seems to solve a problem for a lot of people in theory but the chart types supported seem to put flash over function to some extent or at least have fewer potential uses than more standard chart types.

Roadmap

Developers of D3 help convert chart types to be used in RAW with an API. 
Open source
what's the process for adding new layouts? 
Why didn't RAW start with simpler forms? 

# Raw is amazing because
- It covers a critical issue in the data visualization world that effects lots of people and exists at the lower end of expertise 
- Teaches simples lessons of data visualization through intuitive and playful interface
- It's open source and built to be extended by expert users to more layouts and custom functionality

# Raw could benefit from
- Some more standard, simple chart types to make their value apparent 
- A showcase of completed projects
- a roadmap of chart types you can vote on 
- open source help / support community


his would help what seems like the tool's main audience: visualizers looking for help turning a data set into vector graphics without  the use of code.  

This would seem to line up with the audience for the tool - non-programatically oriented visualizers who are no programming required to create your first visualization



There are a few technical kinks that will get ironed out as the tool progresses. The drag and drop areas are a little sensitive and it's difficult to pick up active data attributes and map them to other layout attributes.

- How did you decide which layouts to include in the first release? Were there any reasons you avoided simpler layouts to start?  

- What's the strategy for getting new layouts? 

- What are the plans for the future of RAW? How can the larger data visualization community be a part of these plans? 

(at this time: treemap, alluvional diagram, bubble chart, circle packing, dendrogram, hexagonal binning).

For the layouts that require certain types of data it would behoove Raw to give more explanation about how to achieve the desired chart type and in the same stroke would educate visualizers about
