(link:http://www.tapestryconference.com/ text:Tapestry) had another successful year in 2014. This time around the event was held in the Historic Inns of Annapolis, MD. In its two year life the conference has adopted a signature feel I haven't found anywhere else: single day, single track, a small crowd of around 100, and, of course, a great mix of speakers broken up by plenty of socialization time. Together these elements make the annual conference feel more like a retreat than anything else. 

Some of the other attendees have already written up their thoughts - (link:http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2014/03/a-short-reflection-about-tapestry-conference/ text:Andy Kirk), (link:http://www.chezvoila.com/blog/tapestry14 text:Francis Gagnon), (link:http://wannabeawesomeme.weebly.com/1/post/2014/03/tapestry-takeaways.html text:Emily Kund), (link:http://blogger.ghostweather.com/2014/03/implied-stories-and-data-vis.html text:Lynn Cherny) - but I wanted to add a few thoughts to the mix and one exciting new idea.

## Discourse

The biggest thing that I took away from tapestry conference this year was the healthy atmosphere of criticism we have managed to foster as a community. 

Presenters were up on stage criticizing or defending the work of visualizers present in the room. This generated plenty of follow-up discussion during breaks. And the best part is that people want more of it.

The fact that this idea popped up several places suggests there's something to it. I try to achieve a facsimile of this with some of the articles on The Why Axis but I love the idea of live critique with the opportunity for rebuttals. I also can imagine a format where the participants get together in a room and record / live-stream their conversation to a much larger audience on the web. 

If you want to team up and make this idea real then don't hesitate to get in touch. I think it could help provide the next layer of social glue to solidify the data visualization community as one at home with constructive criticism.
