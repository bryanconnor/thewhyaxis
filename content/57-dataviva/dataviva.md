Change to another visualization type at any time but the default seems to be the type that makes the most sense for that data. 

"The site, which officially launched last week, can be a bit overwhelming to navigate, but it has lofty goals: to visualize data encompassing the entire Brazilian economy over the last decade, with more than 100 million interactive visualizations that can be created at the touch of a button in a series of apps."

"The future of open government isn't just dumping raw datasets onto a server: It's also about making those datasets digestible for a less data-savvy public."

"THERE’S A LOT OF EFFORT TO MAKE DATA PUBLIC, BUT THERE’S VERY LITTLE EFFORT TO MAKE THE DATA VISIBLE."

"Opening up data in a visual form is essential for transparency, and to empower other people to use this data"
