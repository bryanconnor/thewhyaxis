# A cure for the common health visualization 

Visualizing Health is a gallery of graphics proven to clearly communicate health information to patients. 

The team behind the site built this gallery by testing these graphics with the general public using tools like Google Consumer Surveys, Survey Sampling International and Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

The results were compared and the charts that were easiest to understand and most impactful are marked with a star on the site. The rest of the visualization tested are there too and contribute to a sizable library of risk focused visualizations. In addition, The Wizard helps narrow down the gallery by asking easy to understand questions about your goals in communicating health information. 

## Comments 

Visualizing health has taken a really useful and logical leap by testing which visualizations are best at communicating health information. However, I think they fall short in making these visualization accessible to people who want to use them. The charts are licensed under the Creative Commons but in the end they're un-editable png files. Anyone who wants to use a chart with different data would have to recreate it themselves. 

The (link:http://www.vizhealth.org/using/calculator/ text: risk calculator) is a step in the right direction, generating an image based on inputs of patient data but it's the only recommended chart that does this.

I think the team also missed an opportunity by burying the results of comparison in the research report. There's a lot to be learned from explaining exactly why one chart variation is easier to understand or why one is more impactful. Giving people the information they need to choose a visualization can be more effective than making decisions for them. And most useful of all would be providing editable graphics so people can use the site the way it was intended - as a springboard for better communicating with patients. 






Even more simple and useful would be a comparison of the results for each chart and an explanation of why each chart one out. This is essentially what the report has done but the site built around it feels futile without a way for people to really pick up and use these charts.  




The site was created by the University of Michigan in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and was led up by Thomas Goetz, Entrepreneur-in-residence at RWJF.

Josué Blanco of Aggregate originally shared this with me and said: 

> Data abounds when it comes to our health, but practitioners lack the ability to make it useful in communicating helpful information that promotes a culture of health. Visualizing Health works to integrate smart and proven design and data visualization practices to help people make better and more effective choices about their health.

The team behind the tool created a large set of visualizations to communicate risk information and tested them with the general public to find the most effective ones. The testing process involved getting feedback from Google Consumer Surveys, Survey Sampling International, and Amazon Mechanical Turk and comparing the results. The entire set is available on the site but the standouts are marked with a star on one or more of their labels. 













# Outline
- Best practices based on research. proven.
- "All the data visualizations are shared via Creative Commons and are meant to be a springboard for others to jump off of"
- Communication approaches are something you don't often see but make a lot of sense for healthcare data. 

# Reactions
it's a repository of specialized visualizations that have been tested in the realm of health but i can't really do anything with that information. no way to use it. 

the wizard is just a fancy way to check options in the sidebar
images are all uneditable pngs so these aren't terribly easy to re-create. 
Risk calculator is the coolest part because it generates a graphic based on your inputs.

# Recommendations
take what testing these graphics have taught you and offer only the best in a format that people can actually use with real patient data. 

# Questions
- Wizard is cool. Where'd that come from? 
- What's planned for the future of visualizing health? 
How does Aggregate relate to this project? 

# Visualizing Health

I wanted to connect with you on a new project that you may find useful for The Why Axis. Visualizing Health is a new resource that explore and share best practices for visualizing data to communicate health and risk information. It was done in partnership between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Michigan and was led up by Thomas Goetz, Entrepreneur-in-residence at RWJF.

Data abounds when it comes to our health, but practitioners lack the ability to make it useful in communicating helpful information that promotes a culture of health. Visualizing Health works to integrate smart and proven design and data visualization practices to help people make better and more effective choices about their health.

I think your network and audience may appreciate the work to integrate design and health for the benefit of all people. All the data visualizations are shared via Creative Commons and are meant to be a springboard for others to jump off of – dataviz designers can take this and run. Visualizing Health was meant to be shared freely, so pass it around to anyone you think would benefit from it.

If you're interested in learning more or want to connect with someone from the Foundation for a potential interview, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks for your attention.
