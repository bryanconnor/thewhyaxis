After looking at (link:http://thewhyaxis.info/variance/ text:Variance) I wanted to examine other graphing tools that don't require a signup and can be licensed directly by individuals. A charting library with a business model suggests sustainability and makes for a strong candidate for your next project. 

(link:https://plot.ly/plotly.js/ text:Plotly.js) is the library that powers the web tool of the same name but can be downloaded and hosted separately. They don't publish prices but an email to (email:sales@plot.ly) will give you a better picture (and individual service). 

Plotly.js features many standard graph types but prides itself on their chart types geared towards scientists such as box plots, histograms, error bars, log scales, multiple y-axes and more. It also features a grammar similar to that used in Variance - you encode attributes of the graph in the "data" and "layout" objects, then plotly.js builds the graph from there.

I think the thing that sets Plotly apart from other charting libraries is the community that has been set up around it. The (link:https://plot.ly/feed text:Plotly feed) catalogs a huge amount of charts created with the tool. 

Jack Parmer, Plotly's CEO, told me: 

> We created the feed because we thought there should be a place where you can see what everybody else using Plotly is up to. We designed it to promote more conversation, more constructive criticism, and more collaboration.

Each item can be (link:https://plot.ly/10/~NYT-Upshot text:forked and edited) with Plotly, making it incredibly easy to see how each is built. Each poster to the feed has a (link:https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/ text:public profile page) and every graph can be commented on or improved by other members of the community. All this goes a long way to making the community and the library seem friendly and easy to use which I'm sure wins it many converts.
