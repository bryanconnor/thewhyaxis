# Plotly.js powers the tool that's cracked community

After looking at (link:http://thewhyaxis.info/variance/ text:Variance) I wanted to examine other graphing tools that don't a signup and can be licensed directly by individuals. A charting library with a business model means sustainability and makes for a strong candidate for your next project. 

(link:https://plot.ly/plotly.js/ text:Plotly.js) is the library that powers the web tool of the same name but can be downloaded and hosted separately. They don't publish prices but an email to sales@plot.ly will give you a better picture (and individual service). 

Plotly.js features many standard graph types but prides itself on their chart types geared towards scientists such as box plots, histograms, error bars, log scales, mulitple y-axes and more. It also features a grammar similar to that used in Variance - you encode attributes of the graph in the "data" and "layout" objects, then plotly.js builds the graph from there.

I think the thing that sets Plotly apart from other charting libraries is the community that has been set up around it. The (link:https://plot.ly/feed text:Plotly feed) catalogs a huge amount of charts created with the tool. 

> We created the feed because we thought there should be a place where you can see what everybody else using Plotly is up to. We designed it to promote more conversation, more constructive criticism, and more collaboration.

Each item can be (link:https://plot.ly/10/~NYT-Upshot text:forked and edited) with Plotly, making it incredibly easy to see how each is built. Each poster to the feed has a (link:https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/ text:public profile page) and each graph can be commented on or improved by other members of the community. All this goes a long way to making the community and the library seem friendly and easy to use which I'm sure wins it many converts.



 

Plotly.js is the charting library that powers the Plot.ly platform. 

For scientists, students, engineers, analysts
Proud of their chart types more geared towards scientists. 
Recreating the functionality of mapplotlib with modified d3.

Pretty high barrier to entry - have to get in touch with sales just to evaluate the code. 

there's also of course the hosted version which has two paid plans and a free tier. 

Our dream is to become the Instagram for graphs, i.e. a forum for the exchange of interesting data and beautiful graphs, by every kind of user

Built on D3

Something to do with R

Great! Thanks! I think plotly.js is pretty similar to Variance, honestly, but we focus much more on charts for scientists. Ie, we pride ourselves on box plots, histograms, error bars, log scales, mulitple y-axes, etc. 

We're trying to recreate the functionality of matplotlib or MATLAB's graphing library using a modified version of d3.js.
