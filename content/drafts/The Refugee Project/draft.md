> "Peraza says that integrating individual voices is at the top of their wishlist. “We’re kind of thinking of this as a beta release of the project,” he says. A future version might tell the stories of the asylum countries, like Lebanon, which has seen it’s population of four million swell to almost five million due the past year’s influx of Syrian refugees. Or maybe it could include the stories of economic migrants such as undocumented Mexican nationals in the U.S., or those who have been internally displaced within their own countries, neither of which appears in the UNHCR’s dataset."

> "For now, Peraza hopes readers will leave the project with a little more compassion and knowledge. “Goal number one is to make people aware that this is still happening,” he says."

> "The team also mixed in narratives from about 80 individual refugee conflicts (from Rwanda to Afghanistan), and set the whole thing on a yearly timeline."

> Despite that the demand for, and the field surrounding, these types of data visualizations is growing in this data-rich era, such sophisticated projects, addressing important world issues, are still relatively rare outside of well-funded media outlets. 
> Hyperakt’s Creative Director Deroy Peraza told me that The Refugee Project took 500 hours of work between six collaborators, and it was a project that Hyperakt took on as a labor of love when they had time between client work.
