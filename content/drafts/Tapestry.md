The thing that I took away from tapestry conference this year was the healthy atmosphere of criticism we have fostered. 

Presenters were up on stage criticizing the work of people who were in the room. Presenters disagreed with keynote speakers. And the best part about it was that people want more of it. 

> DataViz conf idea: series of innovative & classic graphics. Convo on stage btwn viz creator & a detractor. Much 2 be learned from both sides

> What I love about the data visualisation community is that there are many different opinions but no rifts, only debate #tapestryconf

> @albertocairo @acotgreave I think the next viz conf needs to be a round table.

> Opening remarks from each, then discussion MT @krees @acotgreave The next #visualization conference needs to be a round table #tapestryconf

> @krees @albertocairo that is a great idea.  More discourse would really challenge people's opinions

> @vlandham @krees @albertocairo @acotgreave I'll absolutely host. Aiming to host a national vis practitioner conf too, eventually.
