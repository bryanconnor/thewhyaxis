# Digital Attack Map

The Digital Attack map is a collaboration between Google Ideas and Arbor Networks. It is the visual centerpiece for an important Google initiative - protecting vulnerable websites from DDos attack. Project Shield allows sites serving media, elections and human rights related content to be protected from DDos attack by Google's technological infrastructure. The map visualizes why this protection is important. Without it free speech on the internet is under attack. 

The tool is kept current with new data every hour and shows historical data back to June of 2013. Scrolling through the timeline adjusts the visualization of attacks and also shows related news about DDos attacks on that date below. 

The selected date is reflected on all country-specific graphs which can be used to filter the timeline and visualization. Clicking on countries on the map also filters the timeline to reveal dates when these countries were active. These features combined make the attack map very easy to explore.

Each day on the timeline can be linked to, making the gallery of important events possible. They reveal some fascinating patterns of attack that span the globe. The visual representation of the attacks make sense for the most part. The directionality is intuitive and the shapes of attacks are easily explained with the key. The bar at the bottom of the map for attacks of unknown source and destination is the only strange element. Perhaps because of its placement it feels like an afterthought but its presence does illustrate the complex and obscure nature of this data. 

Google's initiative gives credibility to the "Don't Be Evil" motto and the attack map visualization supports their goal of helping sites make decisions that can reduce the threat of digital attacks.

> "Google Ideas collaborated with Arbor Networks to build a data visualization that maps daily, global DDoS attacks. The tool surfaces anonymous data related to these attacks, letting users explore historical trends and make the connection to related news events."
> "By surfacing this data and providing insights on the global patterns of DDoS attacks, we hope that more informed decisions can be made that can reduce the threat of digital attacks"

> Google Ideas has launched Project Shield -- an initiative that uses Google’s own DDoS mitigation technology to provide protection for free expression online, by allowing other websites to serve their content through Google’s infrastructure.

> The service is currently available for 'trusted testers' on an invite-only basis. People with sites serving media, elections and human rights related content are invited to apply for an invite.
