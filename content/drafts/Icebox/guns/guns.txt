Commentary on Globe: http://andrewgelman.com/2013/01/ugly-ugly-ugly/

Published very close together so the globe one was more of a riff off of the gay rights wheel which I critiqued at (rainbow). 

# Interview with The Guardian team about the changes they made to the form since re-using it on the gun-rights law graphic. 

# Is The Glove at fault for re-using the chart type? or are they using a visualization form that's been popularized and used for data driven journalism? 
if they give credit (they do (now)). why can't they use it an try to improve upon it (the failed at that.)
