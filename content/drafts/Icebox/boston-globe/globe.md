### GLOBE

The Boston Globe is known as one of the first fully responsive major news websites. 

- Can you talk about your design process for a visualization like Inaugural Language and how responsive design comes into play? What screen sizes did you optimize for? What challenges does data visualization specifically present for responsive design? 

What kind of constraints did this project have? Time? Technical? Other? 

Do you or the Globe staff have plans up keep and update this visualization for future inaugurations? Or extent the data further into the past? 

Can you talk about the data source a bit? How did you work with the data to create the visualization we see? What got brought forward or left back?

Did you have any visual precedents or examples that led you to this form for visualizing this type of data. 

Were there any alternative versions you considered? If so would you mind showing them, perhaps with a short description of their strengths and weaknesses?

Fill us in on the Canvas and SVG technologies used for this visualization. Were there any challenges or limitations there?

Any other insights into your design process would be greatly appreciated by our readers.
