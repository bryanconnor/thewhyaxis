Code for The Why Axis

The Why Axis is built with Kirby, a file-based CMS that runs best on Linux, Apache and PHP 5.2+.

It can be run locally using MAMP or something similar (MAMP instructions: http://getkirby.com/blog/mamp) 

The Why Axis also uses Compass / Sass to generate its stylesheet from assets/sass to assets/css
